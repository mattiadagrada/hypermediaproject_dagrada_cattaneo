			<h3> The future of our country passes through social and technological innovation. 
				Just in the year 2015 we laid 2.2 million km of fiber-optic network. 
				In the Group, about 53 thousand people work every day with this objective in mind. 
				For the development of innovative technologies we will invest around 6.7 billion euros by the end of 2018.
			</h3>
			<p> We develop new generation infrastructures with the goal of ensuring that around 84% of Italian houses have coverage via the new fixed ultra-broadband network and 98% of the population via  the new mobile network by the end of 2018. 
				As we believe digital technologies are the basis for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. 
				By the end of March 2016, with a total of 11 million km of installed fiber, the fixed network has already reached 45% of the houses and 1,100 municipalities; the mobile network reached 92% of the population and 6,200 municipalities.</br></br>
				To simplify the daily life there are new solutions: electronic payment systems, smart homes, electronic medical records and certified electronic mail in the healthcare and government sectors, for the schools  interactive multimedia whiteboards and web-based learning environments. 
				For businesses, advanced platforms for cloud computing for the virtualization of applications and infrastructures, a vast selection of applications for storing and managing data or controlling energy consumption, products and software to enhance the use of digital signatures.</br></br>
				For everyone, digital technology means to be always connected and access services and digital  content - games, e-books, music and films, all constantly enriched with premium contents - with ease and safety; all of this seamlessly on smartphones, tablets or other devices.</br></br>
				Through the M-Mobile Foundation we promote a vision of innovation and technology as social enablers, supporting projects in the fields of  digital education and cultural innovation. 
				As a result of the companyâ€™s social and environmental commitment, we have been included among the most important and selective stock market Sustainability indexes worldwide, for the last eleven years.</br></br>
