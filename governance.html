			<h3><b> M-MOBILE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE </b></h3>
			<p> The system of corporate governance adopted by M-Mobile, articulated according to the traditional method, is focused on the role of leadership in the strategic decision taken by the Board of Directors, on the transparency of management choices, both within the company as well as in respect to the market, on the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control system, on the strict discipline of potential conflicts of interest and on firm principles of conduct for transactions with related parties.</br></br>
				This system, which was designed and built in light of the principles elaborated by the Committee for the Corporate Governance of the Italian Stock Exchange and the best international practices, has been implemented with the adoption of codes, principles and procedures which characterize the activities of the different organizational and operational components, which are constantly subject to verification and update, to respond effectively to the evolution of the regulatory situation and to the mutation of operational practices.</br></br>
				We are convinced that a good corporate governance can and has to always identify new margins for improvement, in light of external stimuli and constraints, as well as application experience.
